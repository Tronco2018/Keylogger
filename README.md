!IMPORTANT!
THE BATCH FILE IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS, FOR LINUX USE TERMINAL MANUALLY!
I CAN DEVELOP A LINUX VERSION WRITE ME ON DISCORD DM "Tronco2018",
THE LOGGER REQUIED THE PYNPUT LIBRARY! FOR INSTALL IT WRITE "pip install pynput"

!HOW IT WORK!
You need to start the file (.bat for windows and .py for linux).
After you can start typing, when you want to stop it just press esc key.
Go to the folder where do you run the program, you see the file "tasti.txt" (don't rename it!),
open it and you have the words (it work with letters, numbers, special characters)

!BUGS!
*fixed*The space don't count
